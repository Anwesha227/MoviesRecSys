We shall try to create a Recommender System to show personalized movie recommendations based on ratings given by a user and other users similar to them in order to improve user experience. 
 - We shall format, group and collate the data from data sources containing details about movies, users, ratings. We shall engineer some additional features. Then we shall clean and visualize the data.
 - Then we shall use collaborative filtering using both user-based and item-based approaches. 
 - We shall create a CSR matrix representation of the ratings matrix and then utlizie nearest neighbor approach with cosine similarity as the distance metric to get top recommendations based on a given preferred movie. 
 - Next we shall implement matrix factorization using tensorflow to provide recommendations based on users' predicted ratings.
